| Explanation of scale | Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts. This might mean we haven't covered the topic yet, work is incomplete, or work contains too many issues to justify correcting each one. | Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but some significant gaps remain. Needs more work.                              | Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work, and clear documentation. Some revision or expansion might be needed, but no significant gaps or errors are present.                                                                                                                                                  | Work meets or exeeds the expectations.

I only really ask for help if I cant find a straight up answer on the internet or its just a really weird error to where i dont know where to start.                                                                                                                |  |

Before I would make sure I understood everything before trying to implement it. But during late last semester and early this semester I realized that just trying code where im not exactly sure its going to work usually turns out to help me understand it quicker and easier. |  |

I try to be as honest as I can. And I dont take feedback as critism but more as "here's an idea" or constructive critism because I know feedback is really ment to help me weather its good or bad.                                                                                         |  |
